# KidsHub
challenge from smartXmedia

The application is working according to the requirements. The app is receiving json responds from an API and process the data into different categories. All of the network
calls are performed asynchronous with Loaders. 
The design is adapted both in portrait and landscape view with added custom font, background and posters from the server. 
The open source Picasso library (http://square.github.io/picasso/) has been imported into the project to help displaying 
the posters. SQLite database is cashing the downloaded data which is saved for offline mode. 
The user is always aware if it's in offline or online mode. Other Android features added into the project are ability to 
swipe to refresh lists and the appearing of snackbars for notifications.
